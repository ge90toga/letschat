This is an ionic project uses Firebase as real-time data service 
with facebook login allowing users to enjoy one to one chat for personal tech learning and fun. 

## Demo
a short and not comprehensive demo of this app is available on https://youtu.be/GMK_SmUvBuc

## Specification

The project is intended to follow a small specification I made from [specification](www/spec.md).

This project is based on my other repository [chatlover](https://bitbucket.org/GE90TOGA/chatlover), the reason 
why I started this new project is simply because I was at the very beginning stage of understanding ionic, npm bower gulp...
management when I did the my first chatlover project, therefore I only version controlled my www folder leading to a very complex
restore procedure when I need to restore project and maintain my version control. And since I shared my previous project to others who I 
would not like to bother by structurally updating the whole project, I decided to make a "new" one. 

## Workflow
The `master` branch is protected (pushing to the branch is not possible). 
When done with a milestone, merge with a pull request.

## Project Setup

#### 1) Install ionic v1

Please follow https://ionicframework.com/docs/v1/getting-started/ to set up ionic on your computer.

#### 2) Initialise project
Replace YOURAPPNAME with your project name
```bash
git clone https://bitbucket.org/GE90TOGA/chatapp YOURAPPNAME
cd YOURAPPNAME
npm install
bower install
ionic state restore --plugins
```

## Run
Use ionic serve to view it in browser
```bash
ionic serve -c
```

For iOS:
```bash
ionic platform remove ios // remove the platform if you have compile issue
ionic platform add ios

If you encounter errors in build, usually you can remove the platform and add, build again. Usually it will be solved.
If not please raise an issue.
For Android:
```bash
ionic platform remove android
ionic platform add android
ionic build android
ionic emulate android
```
